    <header> What is Playwrite Occupational therapy?</header>
    <p>
        Occupational therapy (OT) helps people with health challenges participate in daily life to the fullest.
        OTs help patients return to the lives that they love. We recognize that an injury or illness can be devastating, and we know that much of the healing process involves being able to participate in daily life in ways that matter the most to each specific patient.
        Our role is to serve as a guide, by helping each patient establish health and life goals—and then working with them to find the interventions, technology, and equipment that work best to get them where they want to be.
        Here at Playwrite our Passion for under-privileged communities who do not have these services in their area and are in need of them.

    <header> Fun activities for kids </header>
    <p>
        Daily tasks your OT can help your kid complete:
       
        Play Skills: Play, play, play! That is what kids do all day, everyday and there is a reason for that. 
        Playing is incredibly important to help children develop social, cognitive, motor, and interactive skills. 
        When children have trouble engaging in play it can impact all of these areas. OTs can help children gain appropriate fine motor skills, strength,
        and hand-eye coordination to increase your child’s ability to interact with toys and engage in play!

        Social/Emotional Regulation: One of the greatest skills children develop is the ability to self-regulate when they need to do things such as focus or engage with their peers. When children struggle with regulation this can have a significant impact on their
        social and emotional well-being. OTs can help children develop skills to monitor their regulation, develop better ways to regulate, and provide activities to address any sensitivities that may be impacting their regulation. For example, some children really struggle with sound,
        so much so that it impacts their ability to engage in their classroom activities.
        OTs can help children build their tolerance and ability to process sound input to improve their ability to attend in a noisy environment.

        Self-Care Skills: Completing those daily ‘self-care’ tasks are crucial in allowing your child to build their independence. When kids struggle with these daily tasks, 
        it can mean starting every day off with frustration.
        OTs can help children build their independence when getting dressed by including fasteners (buttons, zippers) or teaching how to tie shoe-laces.
        OTs can work on the sequencing, motor planning and motor skills needed to complete these activities.
        Once mastered, this can make those mornings before school much more successful and enjoyable for kids!

        Activities to promote development:
        •	A routine of daily interactive reading.
        •	Parents asking their child questions.
        •	Parents answering their child’s questions.
        •	Encourage the child’s interest in learning activities.
        •	Limiting television and online games to 2 hours daily.
        •	Encourage more interactive play.
